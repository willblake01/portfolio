A modern, performance-focused **personal portfolio** built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.  
This site highlights selected projects, technical depth, and real-world engineering experience with a strong emphasis on **clean architecture**, **maintainability**, and **user experience**.

Built specifically for **recruiters, hiring managers, and engineering teams** evaluating production-quality frontend and full‑stack work.

---

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

- Advanced **React** patterns and **Next.js App Router** usage
- Strong **TypeScript** discipline with scalable project structure
- Experience building **interactive, real-time, and 3D-enabled** web interfaces
- Performance-conscious UI development
- Clean, readable code designed for long-term maintenance
- Practical engineering decisions over demo-only abstractions

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Modern CSS

### Advanced Capabilities

- Three.js / interactive 3D experiences

### Platform & Tooling

- Vercel (CI/CD + hosting)
- ESLint
- Modern build tooling
- `next/font` with Geist for optimized typography

---

## ⚡️ Performance & UX

- 3D content (React Three Fiber / WebGL) is isolated to a client-only route/component and loaded via dynamic import (`ssr: false`) to keep initial JS lean.
- Real-user performance is tracked using Vercel Speed Insights (Core Web Vitals: LCP / INP / CLS).
- Analytics are collected via Vercel Analytics.

---

## ⭐ Highlighted Projects

This portfolio includes:

- Interactive UI experiments
- Performance-sensitive frontend features
- Real-time and visual projects that mirror production constraints

Each project emphasizes **clarity, scalability, and user impact** rather than novelty alone.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
